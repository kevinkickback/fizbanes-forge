## Recommendation for AI Agent

### Approach 1: Complete Documentation First (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Complete roadmap before execution
- No surprises during implementation
- Can validate entire approach before starting
- Easier to ensure consistency

**Cons:**
- More upfront time investment
- Can't validate with real code until documentation done

**Process:**
1. Complete PHASE_2_IPC.md (2 hours)
2. Create PHASE_3_STATE.md (4 hours)
3. Create PHASE_4_BUSINESS_LOGIC.md (8 hours)
4. Create PHASE_5_PRESENTATION.md (5 hours)
5. Create PHASE_6_TESTING.md (4 hours)
6. Review all documents for consistency
7. Begin execution with Phase 1

**Timeline:** 23 hours documentation + execution time

### Approach 2: Just-In-Time Documentation
**Pros:**
- Can start execution immediately with Phase 1
- Validate approach with real code earlier
- Less documentation if approach needs adjustment

**Cons:**
- Possible inconsistencies between phases
- Might need rework if later phases reveal issues
- Context switching between writing docs and coding

**Process:**
1. Execute Phase 1 now (ready)
2. Complete PHASE_2 docs, then execute
3. Complete PHASE_3 docs, then execute
4. Continue pattern for remaining phases

**Timeline:** Distributed across execution

### Approach 3: Hybrid (Balanced)
**Pros:**
- Complete next 2-3 phases of docs, then execute
- Reasonable lookahead without over-commitment
- Can adjust based on learnings

**Cons:**
- Still some context switching
- May need phase doc updates

**Process:**
1. Complete PHASE_2, PHASE_3, PHASE_4 docs (14 hours)
2. Execute Phases 1-4 with real code
3. Complete PHASE_5, PHASE_6 docs based on learnings
4. Execute Phases 5-6

**Timeline:** Two documentation cycles

---

## Current State Summary

**What You Have:**
- Excellent foundation documents
- Complete Phase 1 ready to execute
- 40% of Phase 2 complete
- Clear architecture and standards

**What You Need:**
- Complete Phase 2 documentation
- Create Phases 3-6 documentation
- OR proceed with just-in-time approach

**Recommended Next Action:**

Based on your earlier request for Option B (create all docs first), continue with:

```powershell
# Complete Phase 2
# Then create Phases 3-6
# Then begin execution with Phase 1
```

This ensures the AI agent has complete guidance for all phases before starting work.
